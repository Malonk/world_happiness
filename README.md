## Data sources

For this project we used the following data:

#### World Happiness Report
CSV file about the happiness ranking of various countries for 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019
https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness

#### Weather 
API to access historical weather information

## Project breakdown

- Work with World Happiness report and understand the Data
- Check the available countries and end with a list of countries which are available for all 5 years
- Countries should all have a happiness rank and happiness score
- Narrow down the country list
- Merge the tables for the seperate countries to have all available data in one table
- Further clean the data
- Going through the API documents and understanding the requirements to request data
- Access the API with an API key to request specific weather data
- Add weather information to the table
- Analyse the effect of the weather (sunshine, wind, temperature) to the happiness ranking
